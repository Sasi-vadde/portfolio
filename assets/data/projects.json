  "description": "This project focuses on modeling and controlling the Newell and Lee forced circulation evaporator using MATLAB and Simulink. The system was analyzed for its steady-state and dynamic responses, revealing instability under open-loop conditions. A 2x2 MIMO control strategy was developed from the original 3x3 system using Relative Gain Array (RGA) analysis, and SISO PID controllers were designed and tuned using both Zieglerâ€“Nichols and relay feedback methods to optimize rise time, settling time, and overshoot.",

    "description": "This project involved performing a CFD simulation to analyze the airflow around the Arc de Triomphe. The simulation explored the flow characteristics, including velocity, pressure, drag, and lift forces, for inflow velocities of 9 m/s and 18 m/s. The analysis revealed that while the drag coefficient remains nearly constant for a given flow direction, the drag force itself increases as the velocity increases.",

    "description": "This presentation demonstrates how numerical simulations using OpenFOAM can be applied to explosion prevention by tracking a single particle's motion within a defined box. Using a Lagrangian approach with the Discrete Particle Modelling (DPM) solver, boundary conditions such as inlet/outlet pressures, particle position, and velocity are specified. The simulation results are visualized in ParaView, providing insights into particle trajectories between parallel plates under specified flow and pressure conditions.",
